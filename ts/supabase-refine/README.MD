## Limitation

- Inferencer requires table to have at least one record.
  - See also [How the fields are inferred | Inferencer | refine doc](https://refine.dev/docs/packages/documentation/inferencer/#how-the-fields-are-inferred)
- TODO Error on table with foreign keys, http://localhost:5173/members: "Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {id, team_name}). If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead."
